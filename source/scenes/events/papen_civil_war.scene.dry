Our enemies are the <span style="color: #808080;">nationalist</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>, with [+ sh_strength +] thousand troops, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, with [+ sa_strength +] thousand troops, both fighting on different sides. The loyalties of the Reichswehr, with its [+ reichswehr_strength +] thousand regular soldiers, and Prussian police, with [+ prussian_police_strength +] thousand members, are unclear, with many <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> sympathizers in each. 

Papen is backed primarily by the Reichswehr, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>, Hugenberg and his party, industrial elites, and President Hindenburg himself.

On our side, we have the Reichsbanner, at [+ rb_strength +] thousand members. [? if dissent > 0.15 and dissent <= 0.25: It is somewhat weakened by dissent within the party, and some members choose not to fight. ?][? if dissent > 0.25 and dissent < 0.5: It is weakened by dissent within the party, and many members choose not to fight. ?][? if dissent >= 0.5: It is heavily weakened by dissent within the party, and a substantial portion of members choose not to fight. ?]

[? if rb_militancy < 0.25 : Unfortunately, the Reichsbanner are poorly trained and equipped, and will not be able to stand against our more militarized opponents. ?][? if rb_militancy >= 0.25 and rb_militancy < 0.5 : We have spent some resources training and equipping the Reichsbanner. Let us hope our people can persist. ?][? if rb_militancy >= 0.5 : We have spent quite a great deal of resources on turning the Reichsbanner into a fighting force. Let us hope that they survive. ?]

@defeat

= Total Defeat

Our forces are no match for those of the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>. Reichsbanner fighters are quickly overpowered by the forces of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">Stahlhelm</span>, <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, and Reichswehr. Many are killed before the rest surrender. Our remaining leaders either flee the country or face execution, as the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> soon turn on each other.

[? if papen_win: Following our defeat, the better-equipped Reichswehr and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> turn against the weakening <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, defeating them after a brutal struggle. [+ nsdap_leader +] commits suicide, and many high-ranking <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> leaders are imprisoned. Papen has won‚Äîthough with 90% of the country against him. ?][? if nsdap_win: Following our defeat, the fanatical <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> overwhelms the smaller but well equipped Reichswehr, and uses defections of pro-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> elements in the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> to their advantage. Eventually, Papen, hated by 90% of the German people, is captured and executed along with President Hindenburg. Ernst R√∂hm and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> now have significant influence in the new Germany, vowing to go on a campaign of <span style="color: #7e0000;">**unspeakable**</span> <span style="color: #3f0000;">**horror**</span> against <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span>, and endless wars of violent expansion that will ruin all of Europe.  ?]

Our resistance will be recorded in the history books, and in the future, our names will be honored. But for now, all is lost.

@long_war
go-to: long_war_intervention if resist_coup == 0; game_over_menu if resist_coup == 1

= Long War

The initial phase of the action ends, and somehow, both sides remain standing.

The war settles into fixed battle lines. This will not be a quick coup, but a long civil war. The nation will destroy itself before it can be rebuilt again.

@game_over_menu

While we might want to call for foreign assistance, the foreign powers see the "Prussian Coup" as a purely internal matter.

In a chaotic civil war between the Reichsbanner and <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> parties, <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> and the Reichswehr, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>: the anti-democratic forces are defeated! The infighting between the extremists have largely benefitted us.

The battle lines hold, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>, and Reichswehr forces are defeated. Today, the forces of the republic prevail over the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">reactionaries</span>. There is a new revolution in Germany. Let us hope it produces a longer-lasting peace than the previous one.
