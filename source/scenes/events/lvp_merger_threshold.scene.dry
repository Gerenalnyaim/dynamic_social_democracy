With the passage of a 5% electoral threshold, the two liberal parties now face the real risk of being shut out of parliament entirelyâ€”even with the influx of defectors from various bourgeois factions boosting their numbers. While current polling may look favorable, a single poor electoral cycle could wipe out their representation altogether.

As a result, the two parties are being forced into cooperation, whether they like it or not. A new "Liberal Association" has already made significant strides toward unification, establishing a national framework and drafting a middle-class-oriented policy platform that commands broad support across both parties. 

Industrial backers have also thrown their weight behind the project, reasoning that a party compromised by the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">[+ ddp_name +]</span>'s leftists is still preferable to no representation at all.

The momentum towards liberal unity has proven too great for the holdouts within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s right wing to stand against. The party has officially voted to approve the merger with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, although the latter has yet to reach a final decision.

The aftermath of the congress has significantly diminished the influence of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s right wing, and will shape the ideology of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span> if it is to form.
