= Vote of No Confidence

Due to the formation of the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>, our coalition is no more! It's joever...

If the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> abstain, then we essentially can maintain a minority government[? if president=="Hindenburg":, although it would be very difficult to make policy without the support of President Hindenburg, which we do not have ?]. If this happens, then we will own a massive debt to the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>. This could lead to broader cooperation in the future, for better or for worse.

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is not interested in a "toleration" arrangement; they will only support us if they can participate in the government as part of a coalition. And, if this toleration agreement happens, the right-wing parties will not be inclined to support us.

The vote succeeds, and our government has resigned. Chancellor Brüning has been appointed as the head of a new cabinet, consisting solely of the bourgeois parties. He immediately proceeds to cut welfare spending substantially.

[? if not bruning_event_seen and year >= 1930: New elections haven't been called yet but it's likely that they will be soon, considering Brüning most likely doesn't have the majority of the Reichstag behind him. ?]
