= May 1929 Party Congress

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, as a <span style="color: #c00000;">Socialist</span> Party, is highly committed to democratic and transparent policymaking. Of course, this also extends to our internal party structure. The representatives of local branches meet recurringly to elect the party leadership, and vote on important policy proposals.

Following the [? if blutmai == 1:bloody ?] affairs that occured on May Day, our party is meeting to discuss contentious issues, and (likely) re-elect <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Wels</span> and Crispin as party Chairmen. 

The Party Congress also exists as an enviroment to allow the multiple diverse factions argue and compromise over their different ideas.

- @marxists: And what are these different factions within our party?

@marxists
face-image: img/portraits/WelsOtto.jpg

= The <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">**Centrist Marxists**</span>

Strength: [+ center_strength : strength +]

By far the largest faction within our party, The <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Centrist Marxists</span> embody the concept of Social Democracy. 

They stand at a midpoint between reform and revolution, advocating for the interests of the proletariat in government, while slowly building up the means and the resources to prepare for a Socialist Revolution.

A majority of our party leadership originates from this faction, and since our merger with the <span style="color: #D47B9B;">**USPD**</span>, they have been the primary influence on the direction of our party. Their aim at the moment, is to contain dissent within the right and the left wings of the party, and to seek comprimise. Important party figures from this faction include <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Otto Wels</span>, our longtime Party Chairman, and a bastion of stability to the party, <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Hermann Müller</span>, the [? if not chancellor == "Müller":former ?]Chancellor of Germany, and <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Rudolf Hilferding</span>, our primary economist, and a firm proponent of Governmental Participation.

- @reformists: Who lies to the right of the <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Centrists</span>?

@reformists
face-image: img/portraits/BraunOtto.jpg

= The <span style="color: #F99E9E;">**Reformist Socialists**</span>

Strength: [+ reformist_strength : strength +]

The <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Reformists</span> represent the right wing of our party. In the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, we can count on them to be the first line of defense when it comes to protecting the republic.

They maintain a reformist stance, advocating for the gradual abolition of capitalism through governmental participation. Out of our party, they are the ones pushing for stronger cooperation with the Liberals and Catholics. 

Many important <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> figures come from this faction, such as our former President, <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Friedrich Ebert</span>. The ever popular <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Otto Braun</span> also hails from this wing of the party. 

- @left: And on the left of our party?

@left
face-image: img/portraits/SeydewitzMax.jpg

= The <span style="color: #AF0202;">**Left Socialists**</span>

Strength: [+ left_strength : strength +]

The Left Wing of our party, also known as the <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left Socialists</span>, stand for revolution, and are suspicious of governmental participation with the bourgiousie parties. 

They primarily come from the <span style="color: #D47B9B;">**USPD**</span>, and their policies are similar to that of the former party. They focus on the expansion of our base within the proletariat, as well as advocate for collaboration with the KPD. While our party is quite anti-militaristic, the left are the primary drivers of the ideas of pacifism and internationalism within our party.

Important figures from the left of the party include <span style="color: #AF0202;">Max Seyedewitz</span>, <span style="color: #AF0202;">Kurt Rosenfeld</span>, and <span style="color: #AF0202;">Toni Sender</span>.

- @labor: And what of organized labor?

@labor
face-image: img/portraits/AufhäuserSiegfried.jpg

= The <span style="color: #EF3636;">**Uni**</span><span style="color: #DC5454;">**ons**</span>

Strength: [+ labor_strength : strength +]

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, as a party of the workers, exists in conjuction with the conglomerations of <span style="color: #EF3636;">organized</span> <span style="color: #DC5454;">labor</span>, such as the ADGB. These <span style="color: #EF3636;">Uni</span><span style="color: #DC5454;">ons</span> have a large degree of influence within our party, and advocate for the direct protection and welfare of the working class.

Within our party, Labor itself can be split into two groups. Those more idealogically aligned with marxism, and those who take a more concilatory position on the Liberals and Catholics.

<span style="color: #EF3636;">Left Labor</span> includes figures such as <span style="color: #EF3636;">Siegfried Aufhäuser</span> and <span style="color: #EF3636;">Wilhelm Dittmann</span>. They mostly come from the <span style="color: #D47B9B;">**USPD**</span>, and strongly support socialism and internationalism.

<span style="color: #DC5454;">Right Labor</span> includes figures such as <span style="color: #DC5454;">Theo Leipart</span>, and <span style="color: #DC5454;">Vladimir Woytinsky</span>. While also supporting labor, they are not as idealogically socialist as <span style="color: #EF3636;">Left Labor</span>, and care mainly about the standard of living of the working class.

As the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is a diverse party, there are also many minor groups all pushing for their voices to be heard.

= Governmental Participation

The <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left Socialists</span>, led by <span style="color: #AF0202;">Kurt Rosenfeld</span>, have used the conference to introduce a proposal concerning our future in coalition governments. They seek confirmation that the governing ministers of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> will not compromise with the bourgeoisie parties, and will avoid any reductions in public welfare spending. They argue that to do otherwise would be a betrayal of our working class base and our Marxist values.

The <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Reformists</span> and other moderate elements have pushed back against the proposal, warning that if we were to accept such an agreement it would likely make maintaining any coalition government virtually impossible. They warn that these inflexible demands may risk returning to the instability that plagued the early years of the Republic.

The <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Centrist Marxists</span> and <span style="color: #DC5454;">Right Labor</span> favor a more flexible strategy, which will try to balance protecting democracy with maintaining our commitments to the workers. They support setting boundaries on how far the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> should go in compromising with bourgeois parties, while still allowing for some accommodation in order to preserve parliamentary stability.

What does the congress decide?

Surprisingly, the <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Reformists</span> and their allies have succeeded in blocking any restrictions on our dealings with coalition partners. This represents a notable shift in the Party’s internal balance of power, highlighting how much influence the Reformist wing has gained since we were last in government. Unsurprisingly, the bourgeois parties have welcomed the decision, interpreting it as a sign that the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is moderating its stance and moving closer to the political center of the Republic.
The <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left Socialists</span>, however, are furious. They view the absence of any limitations as the Party capitulating entirely to bourgeois interests. Even the Center has expressed unease about the outcome, with some members warning that such a blank cheque could erode our core commitments to the workers. There are even whispers of another party split, reminiscent of the <span style="color: #D47B9B;">**USPD**</span>’s departure a decade ago.

Surprisingly, the <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left Socialists</span> has prevailed in securing a no-compromise resolution, meaning <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> ministers must refuse any concessions to bourgeois parties and protect public welfare at all costs. This victory reflects the Left’s strengthened position, bolstered by Paul Levi’s successful mobilization of rank‑and‑file activists in industrial districts and by growing disenchantment with the parliamentary leadership.
The <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Centrist Marxists</span> expressed deep unease. While acknowledging the moral clarity of the resolution, they warn that such an uncompromising stance risks isolating the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> and jeopardizing its ability to influence policy from within government. The Reformists are dismayed by the outcome. They fear that zero‑tolerance red lines will alienate potential partners and make effective governance nearly impossible. Similarly, the bourgeois parties view the Left’s victory as a sign that the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is returning to hard‑line positions, making the government's survival far less likely.

The <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left Socialists</span> reacted with disappointment. Though frustrated that stricter no-compromise pledges were rejected, they nevertheless see an opening to hold Center leaders to account should any red lines be crossed. In contrast, the Reformists are relieved about the outcome. While they would have preferred no red lines at all, they welcome the pragmatic spirit of the resolution. The bourgeois parties are content that the Left’s proposal was rejected, but remain wary about our newly adopted red lines.

= Military Policy

The <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left Socialists</span>, led by Paul Levi, have used the conference to bring forward a proposal that the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> categorically reject the Reichswehr, call for its abolition, and advocate replacing it with workers’ militias under direct proletarian control. They argue that any cooperation with the existing army would only serve to legitimise an instrument of bourgeois repression and betray the interests of the working class. However, if we were to accept such an agreement, it would almost certainly alienate moderate and liberal partners in any prospective coalition, making stable government virtually impossible.

The <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Reformists</span> and <span style="color: #CE2D2D;">Centrist</span> elements, led by <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Carl Severing</span>, are firmly against the <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left</span>'s abolitionist motion. In a time of crisis, they maintain, the party must retain a professional military force, albeit one fully subordinated to strict parliamentary and civilian oversight, to safeguard democratic institutions. Severing’s amendment proposes a modified draft defence programme that “republicanises” the officer corps rather than dismantling it, balancing the need for robust national defence with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>’s commitment to democracy. Severing’s address emphasized that only by acknowledging the positive aspects of the Reichswehr could it be truly republicanized, framing his amendment as the blueprint for a democratic defense policy.

With the <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left</span>’s abolitionist motion just carried at the party conference, <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> ministers and deputies are now formally instructed to press for the Reichswehr’s dissolution and its replacement by workers’ militias. Yet this decision remains a party position rather than law. It must still be debated, amended, and approved in the Reichstag. The <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left</span> leadership, riding this wave of triumph, has issued an impassioned call to “reclaim the republic in the name of the working class,” pledging swift action to dismantle existing military structures. In the days ahead, Paul Levi’s faction will be racing to draft concrete legislation and whip <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> Reichstag delegates into line, even as moderate parliamentarians signal they’ll seek major changes once the bill hits the floor.

The <span style="color: #F99E9E;">Reformists</span> are watching anxiously, seeing the <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left</span>’s success at the conference as a clear sign of their own waning influence within the party; many fear it marks the beginning of a broader shift away from their pragmatic approach. With the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> lacking a parliamentary majority to carry the proposal through the Reichstag, Reformists are preparing to argue in committee for a more cautious, limited position—hoping to avoid a public rupture while slowing the momentum behind the Left. Outside the party, the reaction is swift and hostile: conservative parties have condemned the decision as a direct threat to the state, and Hindenburg is reported to be furious at the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>’s ‘stab in the back’. Right-wing paramilitary groups have issued warnings and are calling for mass mobilization, stoking fears that the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>’s internal debate could now spill into the streets.

The <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left</span>’s call for the abolition of the Reichswehr has been decisively rejected, signaling that the party will continue working within the existing state framework to gradually reform the officer corps and <span style="color: #000000;">repu</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">bli</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">canize</span> the military. Carl Severing and his allies have emerged strengthened, their vision of pragmatic governance endorsed by the majority of delegates.
 
The <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left</span> has responded bitterly, warning that the decision marks a retreat from socialist principles and leaves the <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ic</span> in the hands of a reactionary military elite. While some on the party’s radical wing are calling for continued agitation in local branches, their influence within the national leadership has clearly diminished. Outside the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, the response is calmer: the party’s moderate coalition partners have responded with cautious approval, relieved that the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> rejected the more radical path. For leaders in the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and <span style="color: #FFCC00;">the Liberal Parties</span>, the outcome is seen as a sign that the <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democrats</span> remain committed to stability and parliamentary cooperation.

With the conference coming to a close, the various members make their closing statements. While they may have expressively disagreed during the Congress, one thing is certain. For <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democracy</span> to prevail, they must remain united. 

[? if rural_spd_normalized >= 12: The relative success of the <span style="color: #38C538;">**Agrarian Socialists**</span> at increasing <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> support among the rural populace has cemented it's place as a wing of our party. ?]

[? if left_dissent >= 30: The relative dissatisfaction of the <span style="color: #AF0202;">Left</span> has created tensions in our party. It remains to be seen what action they will take in the future. ?]
